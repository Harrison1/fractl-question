Sample Project:

We need a responsive page created that will eventually be converted to Wordpress, but you need not

worry about the Wordpress aspect for the purpose of this test.

This new page should contain the same content found on the this example page but should match the

look and branding of the client’s current website.

● Header and footer content should be the same as the old template and contain nothing additional

to what is seen in the old version

● Main body content should also be the same as what is seen in the old version

● This page needs to be responsive - the responsive nature not perfect now - we encourage you to

improve the responsivity (and any other aspects of the page) as you see fit

● Feel free to use as much code as you can from the two links above - if you want to make

improvements, feel free to do so
